## Text Comparison Tool

This project is a GUI-based text comparison tool developed using Python's Tkinter library. The tool allows users to compare two text files or manually entered texts, providing a similarity percentage and highlighting identical words in both texts.

## Features

- File Loading: Load text from files into the application for comparison.
- Text Comparison: Compare two texts word by word to determine their similarity.
- Similarity Percentage: Displays the similarity percentage between the two texts.
- Text Highlighting: Highlights matching words in both text areas.
- Character Count: Shows the character count for each text area.
- Progress Bar: Visual representation of the similarity percentage.
- User-Friendly Interface: A clean and simple UI with customizable colors and fonts.

## How to Use

1. Load Text Files:
   - You can either load text files into the tool by clicking on the "Load File 1" and "Load File 2" buttons, or you can manually enter text into the text boxes.
  
2. Compare Texts:
   - After loading or entering the texts, click the "Compare" button to see the similarity percentage. The progress bar will fill according to the similarity, and matching words will be highlighted in both texts.

3. View Results:
   - The similarity percentage will be displayed, along with a brief summary of the comparison. Identical words between the texts will be highlighted in the respective text boxes.
